    <h1>Privacy Policy for YetiFi App</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: August 16, 2025</p>
    
    <!-- Paste the full privacy policy text here -->
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how YetiFi ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile app (the "App"). The App provides real-time cryptocurrency news, market sentiment analysis, AI-powered financial insights, and features like news curation through liking/disliking articles, commenting, premium subscriptions, and a trading bot for tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. This policy applies to the beta testing version of the App and may be updated for full release.</p>
    
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. This is for testing purposes and not intended as legal advice—consult a professional for production use.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide and improve the App's features. Types of data include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: When you create an account or sign up, we may collect your email address, username, and password. For premium features or trading bot, we may collect payment information (processed via third-party providers) or API keys for crypto exchanges.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Automatically collected data such as device ID, IP address, app usage patterns (e.g., viewed articles, likes/dislikes), and crash logs to personalize news feeds and analyze trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Data</strong>: Comments you post, preferences for news curation (e.g., liked/disliked articles), and any portfolio or tracking data you input for market insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Location Data</strong>: If enabled, approximate location for geo-relevant crypto news; analytics data via tools like Google Analytics for app performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the App integrates with third-party services (e.g., news APIs like CoinMarketCap, AI for sentiment analysis, or exchanges like Binance), we may collect data shared from those services with your consent.</p>
    <p>We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., racial origin, health data) unless required for a specific feature, and never without explicit consent.</p>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide core features: Deliver personalized crypto news, sentiment analysis, AI insights, and trading bot functionality.</li>
        <li>Improve the App: Analyze usage to curate better news feeds, fix bugs, and enhance user experience during beta testing.</li>
        <li>Communicate: Send updates, notifications about market trends, or responses to your comments/inquiries.</li>
        <li>Process transactions: Handle premium subscriptions or integrations.</li>
        <li>Comply with laws: As needed for legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Third parties for analytics (e.g., Google), payment processing (e.g., Stripe), news sources, or AI tools (e.g., for sentiment analysis).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: If required by law, to protect rights, or in response to subpoenas.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In case of merger or acquisition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All shared data is limited to what's necessary, and providers are bound by confidentiality.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard measures (e.g., encryption, firewalls) to protect your data. However, no method is 100% secure—use strong passwords and report issues promptly. During beta testing, data may be used for debugging.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law. Usage data is kept for [e.g., 12 months] for analytics. You can request deletion via the contact below.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR for EU users), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict your data. Contact us to exercise these. You can also opt out of personalized features or delete your account in-app.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for users under 13 (or 16 in some regions). We do not knowingly collect data from children—if discovered, it will be deleted.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>The App may link to external sites (e.g., crypto exchanges). We are not responsible for their privacy practices—review their policies.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy for new features or legal changes. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.</p>
